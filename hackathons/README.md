# Nevermined AI Agent Examples

Working examples of AI agents with [Nevermined](https://nevermined.app) payment integration. Each agent demonstrates a different protocol (x402, A2A, MCP) and can be run locally with a few commands.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app) account (API key + payment plan)
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)

### Environment Setup

Each agent has its own `.env.example`. Copy and fill it in:

```bash
cd agents/<agent-name>
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

Key variables:

```bash
NVM_API_KEY=sandbox:your-api-key       # From https://nevermined.app > API Keys
NVM_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox                # sandbox, staging_sandbox, or live
NVM_PLAN_ID=your-plan-id              # Create in Nevermined App > My Pricing Plans
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key            # For LLM-powered agents
```

## Agents

| Agent | Description | Protocols | Link |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Buyer Agent** | Discovers sellers, purchases data, tracks spending | x402, A2A | [README](./agents/buyer-simple-agent/) |
| **Seller Agent** | Sells data/services with tiered pricing | x402, A2A | [README](./agents/seller-simple-agent/) |
| **MCP Server** | Payment-protected tools via MCP protocol | MCP, x402 | [README](./agents/mcp-server-agent/) |
| **Strands Agent** | Strands SDK agent with payment-protected tools | x402 | [README](./agents/strands-simple-agent/) |

### Buyer Agent (`agents/buyer-simple-agent/`)

Discovers sellers in an A2A marketplace, purchases data autonomously, and tracks spending with budget limits. Includes a React web frontend for interactive use.

```bash
cd agents/buyer-simple-agent
poetry install
poetry run python -m src.agent          # Interactive CLI (A2A mode)
poetry run python -m src.web            # Web server + React frontend
```

### Seller Agent (`agents/seller-simple-agent/`)

Sells data and services with tiered pricing (1, 5, 10 credits). Supports both HTTP (x402 middleware) and A2A modes with auto-registration to buyer marketplaces.

```bash
cd agents/seller-simple-agent
poetry install
poetry run python -m src.agent          # HTTP server (x402)
poetry run python -m src.agent_a2a      # A2A server
```

### MCP Server Agent (`agents/mcp-server-agent/`)

MCP server with payment-protected tools (search, summarize, research). Includes a setup script that programmatically registers the agent and creates a payment plan.

```bash
cd agents/mcp-server-agent
poetry install
poetry run python -m src.setup          # Register agent + create plan
poetry run python -m src.server         # Start MCP server (port 3000)
```

### Strands Agent (`agents/strands-simple-agent/`)

Strands SDK agent with x402 payment-protected tools and full payment discovery flow. Demonstrates the `@requires_payment` decorator pattern.

```bash
cd agents/strands-simple-agent
poetry install
poetry run python agent.py              # Run agent
poetry run python demo.py               # Run demo
```

## Protocols

### x402 (HTTP Payment Protocol)

Payment negotiation via HTTP headers. The client sends a `payment-signature` header with an access token. If missing, the server returns `402 Payment Required` with a `payment-required` header describing what's needed.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

Standard agent discovery via `/.well-known/agent.json` and JSON-RPC messaging with payment extensions. Agents can auto-register with buyer marketplaces.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Tool/plugin monetization with logical URLs (e.g., `mcp://server/tools/search`). Each tool can have independent credit pricing.
